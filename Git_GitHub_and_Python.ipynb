    "## Instructions:\n",
    "Use this Thanksgiving dataset to explore patterns in the family dining habits.\n",
    "You’ll need to _**interpret**_ the data using summary statistics, **not just report them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using **only the describe function** to answer your questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at the minimum and maximum values of Age, what do they suggest about who attended this Thanksgiving dinner? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The age range spans from 9 to 72, suggesting a multigenerational gathering that included children, adults, and seniors. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Looking at the mean and standard deviation of Dinner_Duration, what do they show about how consistent the mealtime was across family members? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** With a mean of 2.5 hours and a standard deviation of 0.57, most guests stayed for a fairly consistent amount of time, with only moderate variation in how long they lingered.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If someone stayed for 4.8 hours, would you consider them an outlier? _Use the mean and standard deviation to support your answer (Hint: $mean + 2*std$ OR $IQR=Q3−Q1$ and $Upper Bound=Q3+1.5×IQR$)._ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, the threshold is approximately 3.63 hours. Since 4.8 > 3.63, this guest stayed significantly longer than typical and would be considered an outlier.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare the mean and median of Dinner_Servings. What could a large difference between them indicate about family member behavior? _(Hint: 50% is half way in the data set)_ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** Both the mean (3.92) and median (4.0) are very close, indicating that dinner portions were fairly uniform across the group. A large difference would suggest skewed behavior, such as a few guests eating much more or much less than others.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Looking at the max value of Dessert_Servings, what type of guest do you imagine that might be, and what could this tell us about dessert consumption overall?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The guest who had 3 desserts might be a sweet-toothed enthusiast or a younger attendee. This hints that while dessert was available, most people had fewer servings, making 3 an exception rather than the norm.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Suppose the standard deviation of Dinner_Serving is small. What does that suggest about how much everyone ate?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** A small standard deviation (0.40) means most guests ate similar amounts, suggesting a shared meal style or portion control—perhaps everyone was served the same dishes. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which statistic (min, max, mean, std) best helps you find the “light eaters”? Explain how you would identify them and if the minimum makes sense.<br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The minimum is most useful here. A guest with only 3 servings (when most had 4) could be considered a light eater. This makes sense if they were younger, had dietary restrictions, or arrived late. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The range (max − min) of Dinner_Duration is quite large. What could that imply about how the dinner was organized?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The range of 2.5 hours (3.5 − 1.0) suggests flexible timing—some guests may have arrived early and stayed long, while others popped in briefly. This could reflect staggered arrivals or an open-house-style dining experience.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. You suspect that older guests tend to eat fewer desserts. Could you use only the `describe` function to explore whether that idea might be true before doing a full analysis, or would we have to include something else?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** No, you’d need like a scatterplot or correlation analysis (.corr) to explore this relationship. describe() only gives separate summaries, not how variables interact. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does the mean tell you about how common it was for people to watch the Macy’s Day Parade?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** A mean of 0.68 implies that about 68% of guests watched the parade, making it a fairly common tradition among attendees.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the standard deviation suggest about the variation in watching behavior? Was parade-watching behavior fairly consistent across people, or was there a lot of difference between individuals?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** A high standard deviation (0.47) for a binary variable suggests mixed behavior—some watched, some didn’t, indicating that parade-watching wasn’t universal. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In one sentence, summarize what kind of Thanksgiving this dataset represents. Focus on what the numbers imply rather than just stating the numbers.  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** This Thanksgiving was a warm, multigenerational gathering with consistent meals, varied dessert habits, and a shared—but not universal—interest in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Suggest some visuals that would be ideal for exploring this data and state their purpose. <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** We could do a histogram of Ages to show generational spread or maybe a boxplot of Dinner_Duration to highlight consistency and outliers.\n",
